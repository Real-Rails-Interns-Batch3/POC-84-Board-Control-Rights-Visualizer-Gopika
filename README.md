# Board Control Rights Visualizer

![Dashboard Preview](screenshots/dashboard.png)

## Overview

Board Control Rights Visualizer is a governance intelligence dashboard designed to analyze how board composition, voting power, investor influence, protective rights, and governance structures affect decision-making within venture-backed companies.

Built as part of the Real Rails Intelligence Library under the **Capital Formation Rail**, the platform helps users understand how governance control shifts between founders, investors, and independent directors as organizations progress through different funding stages.

The dashboard transforms governance structures into interactive analytics, simulations, and visualizations that support governance analysis, board-control assessment, and strategic decision-making.

# Problem Statement

Ownership percentage alone does not determine control within venture-backed companies.

Board seats, voting rights, governance agreements, and protective provisions often have greater influence over strategic decisions such as:

* Raising new financing
* Budget approvals
* Acquisitions and mergers
* Board expansion
* Executive leadership changes

Understanding who truly controls a company can be difficult because governance information is often fragmented across legal agreements and disclosure documents.

Board Control Rights Visualizer provides a centralized governance intelligence layer that makes governance structures easier to understand, compare, and analyze.

---

# Objectives

The platform is designed to:

* Visualize board composition and governance control
* Analyze voting power distribution
* Identify governance concentration and majority control
* Compare founder and investor influence
* Simulate governance approval scenarios
* Track governance evolution across funding stages
* Highlight governance risks and alerts
* Provide governance intelligence and educational context
* Support governance-focused decision analysis

---

* Data Processing Context

---

## Data Export

Supports:

* JSON Export
* CSV Export

Allowing governance records to be downloaded for further analysis.

---

# Data Sources

## Governance Adapter Layer

The backend implements a governance adapter layer that attempts governance data retrieval and automatically falls back to synthetic governance datasets when external governance feeds are unavailable.

---

## Reference Context

Governance concepts are inspired by:

* SEC EDGAR governance disclosures
* Venture financing governance structures
* Board-control frameworks used in capital formation

---

## Demonstration Dataset

This project uses synthetic governance datasets to simulate:

* Board compositions
* Governance structures
* Voting power distribution
* Protective rights
* Investor influence scenarios
* Governance-stage progression

Synthetic data is clearly labeled and used solely for demonstration and educational purposes.
